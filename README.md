# CrashLet: for those who remember "let" mutable Arrays in Swift

![](img/SourceKitCrash.png)

If you've been using Swift from the very beginning, maybe you remember that dreaded message when the compiler crashed and no code completion / systax coloring worked at all. CrashLet brings you first-class crash Swift experiences, now system-wide.

With CrashLet you can experience that loved message from time to while, while you read your mail, surf the Internet or listen to music in Itunes. It works even while you're developing with Android Studio, just to remind you about how good Swift is at crashing!
